# PISP documentation maintenance

PISP documentation uses two source types:

- stable explanatory pages under `docs/src/` for package purpose, concepts, assumptions, and API reference;
- executable Literate.jl pages under `docs/literate/` for package-derived reference tables, tutorials, data validation, and analyses.

`docs/page-registry.toml` is the authority for every executable page. It records the stable page ID, reader-facing title, page role, data lineage, Literate source, generated Markdown destination, navigation order, evidence producer, evidence directory, and direct local-data requirements.

## Documentation surfaces

| Surface | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `docs/src/index.md` | Package purpose, dataset workflow, and entry points. |
| `docs/src/concepts.md` | Stable explanation of asset relationships, scenarios, traces, and the static/schedule model. |
| `docs/src/assumptions.md` | Modelling scope, caveats, validation responsibilities, and external checks. |
| `docs/src/api.md` | Public API reference. |
| `docs/literate/reference/` | Executable reference pages generated from package constants, schemas, downloader targets, and filesystem checks. |
| `docs/literate/tutorials/` | Executable package and dataset workflows. |
| `docs/literate/validation/` | Executable validation pages that load their own source data, compute their own evidence, and build their own figures directly on the page — the page itself is the analysis, not a consumer of a separate producer script. |
| `docs/literate/analysis/` | Executable analysis pages following the same self-contained pattern as `docs/literate/validation/`. |
| `docs/src/generated/` | Static Markdown and figures generated from all active Literate sources. |
| `docs/eda_support.jl` | Shared table/figure-writer helper used by every page under `docs/literate/validation/` and `docs/literate/analysis/`. |
| `eda/compare_tables.jl` | Regression harness comparing Julia-produced evidence tables against the archived Python baseline under `eda/archive/`, for the pages ported from an original Python analysis. |
| `eda/tables/julia/<script-stem>/` | Current EDA evidence location. |

The public navigation follows reader purpose: reference, tutorial, validation, or analysis. No page in `docs/page-registry.toml` currently sets a `producer`/`evidence_dir`: every executable page computes its own evidence at render time.

## Complete local build

From the repository root, run:

```sh
julia --project=docs docs/build_all.jl
```

The complete build performs these lifecycle stages in order:

1. run each unique `eda/*.jl` producer registered by an active page (no page currently registers one — every page computes its own evidence when its Literate source executes);
2. execute every active Literate source and regenerate its static Markdown and figures;
3. build the Documenter site from the generated files.

The build stops on the first failed producer, Literate page, registry check, or Documenter build. A failed complete render does not replace an existing `docs/src/generated/` tree.

Set `PISP_DATA_ROOT` when the source-data reference page should inspect a download root other than `data/2024/pisp-downloads/`.

Open `docs/build/index.html` after the build completes.

## Run stages separately

### Re-render only what changed (recommended)

After editing one or more Literate sources, render just the affected pages by passing their registry `id`s as a comma-separated list through `PISP_LITERATE_PAGES`. This is the default way to re-render: it is much faster than a full render because it skips every page you did not touch, and it still reruns any registered producer required by the pages you selected.

One page:

```sh
PISP_LITERATE_PAGES=historical-trace-years julia --project=docs docs/render_literate.jl
```

Several pages:

```sh
PISP_LITERATE_PAGES=trace-coverage-and-schema,temperature-data-coverage,generated-output-consistency julia --project=docs docs/render_literate.jl
```

Then build Documenter from the generated files:

```sh
julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
```

### Full render (slower, occasional use)

Render every active Literate page and rerun every registered producer (none currently registers one, so this step is a no-op today). Reach for this before a release, or whenever a change could plausibly affect pages beyond the ones just edited (for example, a shared helper such as `docs/eda_support.jl`), rather than as the routine way to check one edit:

```sh
julia --project=docs docs/render_literate.jl
```

Skip rerunning registered producers, reusing their existing evidence only when it is known to match the current Literate sources (has no effect on pages that compute their own evidence, since those have no producer to skip):

```sh
PISP_RUN_PRODUCERS=false julia --project=docs docs/render_literate.jl
```

Build Documenter from the committed generated files:

```sh
julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
```

`docs/render_literate.jl` defaults to every non-archived registry entry and reruns the unique producers required by the selected pages. A complete render writes all pages to a temporary staging tree and replaces `docs/src/generated/` only after every page succeeds. This removes stale renamed pages without destroying the previous generated site when one page fails. Explicit page IDs can be supplied as a comma-separated list through `PISP_LITERATE_PAGES`, as shown above. Set `PISP_RUN_PRODUCERS=false` only to reuse an already current evidence bundle. The renderer executes each selected source, writes its registered output path, and collapses Julia source blocks behind a **Show source code** disclosure while leaving rendered tables and figures visible.

## Page registry

Each `[[page]]` entry in `docs/page-registry.toml` contains:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable page identity, independent of filenames. |
| `title` | Reader-facing navigation title. |
| `kind` | `reference`, `tutorial`, `validation`, or `analysis`. |
| `data_layer` | `package-workflow`, `source-data`, `pisp-dataset`, or `cross-layer`. |
| `source` | Literate source path relative to `docs/`. |
| `output` | Generated Markdown path relative to `docs/src/`. |
| `status` | `published`, `draft`, or `archived`. Active pages are included in navigation; archived pages are not rendered or published. |
| `nav_order` | Position within the page role. |
| `snapshot` | Whether results describe a dated source or generated-data state. |
| `evidence_dir` | Optional EDA evidence directory relative to the repository root. |
| `producer` | Optional analytical producer relative to the repository root. |
| `data_requirements` | Optional direct local inputs required by the Literate page. |
| `related_reference_pages` | Reference or caveat pages that define the relevant package contract. |

`docs/page_registry.jl` rejects unsupported classifications, unsafe paths, duplicate IDs or outputs, duplicate navigation positions, unregistered Literate sources, orphan generated Markdown, missing producers, and missing related pages. A Documenter build also requires every active registry output to exist.

## Evidence and rendering contract

Every page under `docs/literate/validation/` and `docs/literate/analysis/` is self-contained: the Literate page owns everything reader-facing about its topic, in one place — it loads its own source data, computes its own evidence, builds its own figures, and states its own interpretation:

```text
source data or PISP datasets
    -> docs/literate/{validation,analysis}/<page>.jl   (loads data, computes evidence, builds figures, on the page)
        -> eda/tables/julia/<script-stem>/   (the same code also writes this, for the regression harness)
            -> docs/src/generated/<role>/<topic>.md
```

An earlier producer-consumer split existed for a few pages, where a separate `eda/<stem>.jl` script computed the evidence tables and the Literate page only read and displayed them. That split has been fully retired: no page currently registers a `producer` or `evidence_dir`, and `eda/` holds only the Python-comparison regression harness (`eda/compare_tables.jl`) plus data/figure/table storage directories; the shared table/figure-writer helper lives at `docs/eda_support.jl`. Keep new pages self-contained rather than reintroducing a separate producer script.

Pages under `docs/literate/validation/` and `docs/literate/analysis/` should state the data's vintage or source build directly in their own prose (which download root, output root, schedule directory, or year range the page describes) wherever that materially affects how a reader interprets the evidence. Final claims should be derived from executed evidence or written as interpretation rules rather than hard-coded observations that can become stale.

## Adding a page

1. Choose one primary reader purpose: reference, tutorial, validation, or analysis.
2. Add the Literate source under the matching `docs/literate/` area where practical.
3. Add one registry entry with a topic-oriented output path.
4. Prefer making the page self-contained: load data, compute evidence, and build figures directly in the Literate source (`include`-ing `docs/eda_support.jl` for the shared table/figure-writer helpers), and skip `producer`/`evidence_dir`. State the data's vintage or source build directly in the page's own prose where that materially affects interpretation, rather than as a separate provenance line. Only register a separate `eda/*.jl` producer and `evidence_dir` when there is a specific reason the evidence must be computed outside the page itself.
5. Keep source-derived tables executable rather than copying package constants, filenames, schemas, or repository inventories into plain Markdown.
6. Run the page and inspect the rendered evidence.
7. Run the full documentation build before committing generated Markdown and figures.

## Removing or renaming a page

Remove or rename the Literate source, registry entry, generated Markdown, and generated figures together. Update internal links and decide whether the previous public URL requires a compatibility page or redirect.

`assumptions.md` is the authority for modelling caveats. The earlier standalone `caveats.md` page and duplicate output-validation Literate source are intentionally removed.

## Implementation locations

The generated reference pages read current values from package objects. The main implementation locations remain:

| Concern | Source location |
|---|---|
| Fixed workbook and archive download targets | `src/scrappers/PISP-scrapper-2024files.jl` |
| Trace-page configuration | `src/scrappers/PISP-scrapper-2024traces.jl` |
| Static and schedule schemas | `src/datamodel/` |
| Exported filename mapping | `src/utils/writing/PISPutils-writing.jl` |
| Scenario, bus, area, and weather-year mappings | `src/parameters/general2024ISP.jl` |
| Generator, storage, hydro, build-out, and retirement mappings | `src/parameters/` |
| Renewable-capacity construction | `src/parsers/PISP-2024parser.jl` |
