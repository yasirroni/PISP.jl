# ISP 2024: Output tables

A PISP build writes static asset tables once per build and time-varying schedule tables under one or more schedule directories. The tables below list the current output names, identifiers, relationships, and columns.

## Static asset tables

Static tables define asset identity and time-invariant attributes. Schedule rows should be joined back to these tables through the relationship identifier shown above.

The `Bus` table fixes the spatial resolution of the dataset.

The static tables represent the NEM as 12 sub-regional network nodes spanning the 5 NEM regions - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia - interconnected by the `Line` records.

## Schedule tables

Schedule tables carry scenario- and time-dependent values. The output filename is taken from the same `alt_names` mapping used by the CSV and Arrow writers.

## Schedule value semantics

Each schedule row applies to one asset, scenario, and timestamp. The `value` column overlays the corresponding static quantity when reconstructing the system state for that scenario and time.

Inflow schedules are approximate energy allocations for one unit of the relevant asset. The applicable unit-count field or schedule determines the aggregate quantity represented by multiple units.

## Derived quantities

These quantities are not written as separate columns; they are reconstructed from the static columns when building a system state. Each uses the applicable static or scheduled value for the selected scenario and timestamp: when a corresponding schedule exists, its `value` replaces the static field before the quantity is derived.

`emin` and `eini` are interpreted as fractions of `emax` under the package's stored-value convention.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id_lin` | Unique line or transfer-corridor identifier. |
| `tech` | Line or transfer technology. |
| `capacity` | Maximum line capacity in MW. |
| `id_bus_from` | Bus at the forward-direction origin. |
| `id_bus_to` | Bus at the forward-direction destination. |
| `investment` | Investment flag: `1` for an investment record and `0` for a non-investment record. |

| `fwcap` | Maximum forward transfer capacity per unit in MW. |
| `rvcap` | Maximum reverse transfer capacity per unit in MW. |
| `fullout` | Unplanned full-outage rate for a single credible contingency, represented as a fraction of time. |
| `mttrfull` | Mean time to repair after the contingency, in hours. |
| `n` | Maximum number of line units or parallel elements available. |

A full outage removes the affected unit from service. A partial outage leaves the unit available at a reduced capability determined by the partial-outage and derating parameters. Mean time to repair is the average restoration duration after the corresponding outage state.

## Output directory pattern

Static tables are written directly under a format directory such as `csv/` or `arrow/`. Time-varying tables are written under `schedule-<tag>/`, where the tag is either a planning year or an explicit date range.

A schedule is an overlay, not an independent asset inventory. Reconstruct a system state by selecting the required scenario and timestamp, joining the schedule to its static table, and replacing only the quantity represented by the schedule.

## Using the output tables

- Identifier columns define table relationships; row order does not.
- `scenario` and `date` are part of the schedule key even when an analysis displays only one scenario or period.
- Units follow the represented quantity: power and transfer limits are in MW, storage energy and inflow quantities are in MWh, and unit-count schedules are counts.
- Solar and wind schedule values should not be normalised by static `Generator.pmax` without applying the modelling convention described in [Assumptions and scope](@ref).
