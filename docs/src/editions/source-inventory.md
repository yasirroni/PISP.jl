# Source inventory

PISP keeps source material, parsed structures, and generated datasets as distinct layers.
Keeping those layers separate makes it possible to distinguish an acquired file from a dataset that has been parsed, reconciled, and written by the package.

| Workflow layer | ISP 2024 | ISP 2026 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source acquisition | The documented 2024 build has a configured download root and source workflow. | PISP.jl has download targets for selected source assets and report PDFs. |
| Archive extraction | Integrated into the documented 2024 source workflow. | Available through `PISP.ISPdatabuilder.extract_downloads`. |
| Parser development | The ISP 2024 parser is integrated into PISP.jl. | Under review; detailed coverage and readiness are unverified here. See [Supported ISP editions](supported-editions.md). |
| Parsed and reconciled PISP data | Produced within the PISP 2024 workflow. | No PISP.jl parsed-data contract is yet integrated or documented. |
| Generated dataset | Static and schedule outputs can be written by the 2024 build. | An ISP 2026 dataset-build entry point and generated-output contract are not yet integrated into PISP.jl's documented public workflow. |
| Published validation or analysis evidence | Registry-managed pages cover selected 2024 source and output questions. | No PISP 2026 validation or analysis pages are published. |

## Observed local inventory

The following counts were observed in the local default-profile roots.
They describe non-hidden files present for this documentation build, not a claim about complete upstream coverage, source currency, extraction state, or the files available in another checkout.

| Edition | Download root observation | Report root observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ISP 2024 | 8,250 non-hidden files; 68,352,904 KiB (65.19 GiB). | 10 PDFs; 50,848 KiB (49.66 MiB). |
| ISP 2026 | 817 non-hidden files; 2,380,248 KiB (2.27 GiB). | 10 PDFs; 57,192 KiB (55.85 MiB). |

The presence of a downloaded or extracted file, or parser code under review, does not establish PISP.jl parser integration, an output schema, or analytical comparability.
For the implemented 2024 workflow, consult [data sources](../generated/isp2024/reference/data-sources.md) and [output tables](../generated/isp2024/reference/output-tables.md).
For 2026 source material, consult the [ISP 2026 overview](isp2026.md).
