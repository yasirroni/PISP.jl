# Domain concepts

This page collects a handful of domain conventions that recur across
PISP's build options and output tables, so they have one place to be
looked up rather than being re-derived from tutorial code each time.

## AEMO's three ISP scenarios and the financial-year half split

Every PISP build is organised around AEMO's three 2024 Integrated System
Plan scenarios — *Progressive Change*, *Step Change*, and *Green Energy
Exports* — selectable via the `scenarios` keyword of
`build_ISP24_datasets` (default: all three).

Independently of scenario, PISP also splits each calendar year into two
halves — January–June and July–December — because that 1 July boundary is
where some of the underlying AEMO input files themselves change. Building
a whole planning year always produces one block per scenario per half (so
3 scenarios × 2 halves = 6 blocks for a full year); building an arbitrary
date range only splits at 1 July if the requested window actually straddles
it.

## Reference trace and probability-of-exceedance defaults

Two build-time parameters control which AEMO weather/demand trace year is
used:

- `reftrace` selects the reference weather year trace: an individual
  historical year (2011–2023), or `4006`, which is the trace associated
  with the ISP's Optimal Development Path (ODP) — the default used across
  PISP's own build examples.
- `poe` selects the demand probability-of-exceedance level: 10% or 50%,
  i.e. how likely the modelled demand is to be exceeded in a given year.

Both are ordinary keyword arguments to `build_ISP24_datasets`; there is no
separate "recommended" value baked into the parsing logic beyond the 4006
default used in PISP's own examples and documentation.

## Area map and the solar/wind classification rule

Every bus in PISP's `Bus` table carries an `id_area`, mapping it onto one
of the five NEM market areas (QLD, NSW, VIC, TAS, SA); joining that onto
`id_bus` in the `Generator`, `ESS`, or `Demand` tables (or
`id_bus_from`/`id_bus_to` in `Line`) assigns every other row an area as
well.

When classifying generators as solar or wind — for example, to aggregate
fleet-wide output — match on the `tech` column with a case-insensitive
substring search (`"pv"`/`"solar"` for solar, `"wind"` for wind), not an
exact match on `fuel`. `tech` is the finer-grained column PISP actually
uses to distinguish, for example, rooftop PV from utility-scale PV, so a
`tech`-based match captures distinctions a `fuel`-based match would
collapse.

## Static tables vs. hourly schedules

Every PISP table has a static row per asset, but only some assets also get
an hourly time-varying schedule. In a typical PISP build, generator output
schedules (`Generator_pmax_sched`) exist only for the assets whose output
genuinely varies within a year — chiefly the solar and wind fleet — while
every other generator keeps a single static `pmax` value in the
`Generator` table itself. The same static/schedule split applies to the
other schedule tables PISP produces (demand load, ESS state-of-charge
limits, line ratings, DER prediction): a table only gets a schedule
counterpart where the underlying AEMO input is itself time-varying: this
is also the practical rule for interpreting PISP's output — before joining
in a schedule table, check whether the asset in question actually has rows
in it, or whether its static value in the corresponding time-static table
is already the complete picture.
