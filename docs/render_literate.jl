# Regenerates every `docs/src/generated/*.md` from `docs/literate/*.jl`.
#
# `docs/make.jl` never imports or calls `Literate` — rendering the
# Literate.jl sources is this separate, explicit step, and its output under
# `docs/src/generated/` is committed to Git, not gitignored. A normal
# `makedocs()` build only publishes already-rendered Markdown, so it stays
# hermetic: no network access, no dependency on AEMO data or a website that
# might change. Keeping the two steps apart is what makes that hermetic
# guarantee possible.
#
# Two tutorials, one small literal list and a loop over it — still no TOML
# manifest, no ledger, no CLI flags. That is deliberately as much structure
# as this file has; revisit only if a third tutorial or a second
# repo-specific concern actually needs more than a literal list.
#
# **Not every tutorial here is data-free.** Unlike `problem_table.jl`,
# `pisp_outputs_validation.jl` reads a local AEMO/PISP data build from
# `data/pisp-datasets/out-ref4006-poe10/csv/` that is not produced by this
# repository's normal test/CI path — see that tutorial's own header for
# the full precondition. On a bare clone without that local data build,
# this loop renders `problem_table.jl` fine and then fails on
# `pisp_outputs_validation.jl`; that failure is caught below and reported
# with a clear, named message instead of surfacing as a cryptic
# `CSV.read`/file-not-found error deep inside the tutorial. That is
# expected and does not affect `docs/make.jl`, which never depends on this
# script or on any local data at all.
#
# Usage (from the repository root):
#   julia --project=docs docs/render_literate.jl
