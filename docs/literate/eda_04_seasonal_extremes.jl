# # Examining seasonal renewable extremes
#
# Mean capacity factors do not describe the persistence, timing, or profile of low-output conditions.
# This page organises the evidence from `eda/04_seasonal_extremes.jl` around hot-versus-cool summer comparisons, candidate multi-day low-output events, and detailed solar profiles for adverse days.
#
# The analysis uses one Victorian solar location and one Victorian wind location.
# Its event definitions are exploratory and should not be treated as a system-wide adequacy criterion.

# The grouped summary compares preselected historical summers.

# ## Candidate multi-day low-output events
#
# The current event detector deliberately reproduces the indexing behaviour of the earlier Python analysis.
# Because the filtered summer rows retain original row labels, events crossing excluded months can receive inflated or otherwise misleading durations, and positional pairing can shift when start and end counts differ.
# Treat this table as compatibility evidence until the event algorithm is replaced or independently validated.

# ## 2019 monthly and Black Summer detail
#
# The monthly table provides a calendar context for the detailed summer series.
# The three-day rolling value is descriptive and should not be interpreted as a dispatch or storage requirement without a separate system model.

# ## Interpretation after execution
#
# Replace this section after inspecting all event rows and profiles.
# The final interpretation should separate robust observations from artefacts of the compatibility event detector, state the selected thresholds and locations, and avoid translating a renewable trace statistic directly into a reliability conclusion.
