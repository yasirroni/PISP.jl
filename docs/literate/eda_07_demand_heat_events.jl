# # Demand stress and low-solar coincidence
#
# High demand can coincide with low renewable availability, but that relationship must be evaluated with aligned dates, explicit thresholds, and a clear event definition.
# This page organises the evidence from `eda/07_demand_heat_events.jl` around Victorian demand distributions, demand-defined stress days, hourly demand profiles, and solar availability on selected high-demand dates.
#
# The source EDA uses `heat event` as an operational label for days at or above the 95th percentile of demand.
# It does not use air temperature, an excess-heat factor, or a meteorological heatwave definition.

# The detail table reports solar capacity factor for the selected top-demand dates that could be matched to the trace.

# ## Interpretation after execution
#
# Replace this section after inspecting the complete merged data and threshold tables.
# The final interpretation should use `demand stress day` unless an external temperature series supports a meteorological heat-event definition, report the percentile thresholds explicitly, and avoid inferring system reliability from one solar site and one demand schedule alone.
