# # REZ resource potential versus connection cost
#
# This analysis asks whether Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) with larger workbook-derived resource potential also have higher expected connection cost, or whether resource potential and connection cost are effectively separate dimensions.
#
# The evidence comes from the AEMO 2024 ISP Inputs and Assumptions workbook at `data/2024/pisp-downloads/2024-isp-inputs-and-assumptions-workbook.xlsx`.
# The workbook sheets named most naturally for the question are not directly joinable: `Renewable Energy Zones` identifies REZ geography without numeric resource limits, while `REZ Costs forecast` gives named cost trajectories without REZ-level capacity figures.
# The evidence therefore uses `Build limits` for `total_resource_limit_mw` and `REZ Augmentations Options` for the primary option's `expected_cost_million`, joined by REZ identifier and name, all computed live on this page.
#
# No AEMO report-PDF page citation is currently verified for this specific workbook-derived join, so this page cites only the local workbook-derived evidence.

# A Pearson coefficient of 0.016 across 22 usable REZ rows is effectively zero for this workbook-derived join: the REZs with the highest resource potential do not also tend to have the highest primary-option expected connection cost.
# The join contains 23 rows before ratio/correlation filtering, and N12 (Illawarra) is the single excluded zero-resource row; it remains visible in the evidence because its `0 MW` resource limit is part of the workbook-derived data and makes a finite cost-per-resource ratio undefined.
# N4 (Broken Hill) has the largest expected cost at \$5,098M, while T4 (North Tasmania Coast) is the most cost-efficient joined REZ at about \$0.0051M per MW of resource.
# N8 (Cooma-Monaro) is the least cost-efficient joined REZ at \$1.0100M per MW of resource.
#
# The main limitation is source structure: this is not a direct join between `Renewable Energy Zones` and `REZ Costs forecast`, because those sheets do not contain the numeric fields needed for the question.
# The result should therefore be interpreted as a workbook-derived comparison between REZ resource limits and first-listed standalone augmentation-option cost, not as a complete cost-benefit assessment of every possible augmentation pathway.
