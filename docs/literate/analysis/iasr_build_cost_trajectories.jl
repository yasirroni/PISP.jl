# # IASR build-cost trajectories by technology
#
# This analysis asks how projected capital costs for the main VRE and storage technologies (utility-scale solar, onshore/offshore wind, battery storage) evolve across the projection years in the IASR "Build costs" sheet, and whether the annualized rate of cost decline differs materially by technology.
#
# The evidence comes from the AEMO 2024 ISP Inputs and Assumptions workbook at `data/2024/pisp-downloads/2024-isp-inputs-and-assumptions-workbook.xlsx`, sheet `Build costs`, computed live on this page.
#
# No AEMO report-PDF page citation is currently verified for this question, so this page cites only the local workbook-derived evidence.

# ## Interpreting the evidence
#
# Every matched technology's build cost falls in every scenario, but the annualized decline rate spans roughly a 5.5x range across technologies and scenarios -- from about -0.78%/yr (Wind - offshore (fixed), GenCost Current Policies / Progressive Change) to about -4.30%/yr (Battery storage 8hrs storage, GenCost Global NZE by 2050 / Green Energy Exports).
# The fastest-declining technology is itself scenario-dependent, not fixed: in the two lower-decarbonization scenarios (GenCost Current Policies, Progressive Change), Large scale Solar PV declines fastest, ahead of every battery duration, with Wind - offshore (fixed) slowest; in the four higher-decarbonization scenarios (Global NZE post 2050, Global NZE by 2050, Green Energy Exports, Step Change), the longer-duration battery storage technologies decline fastest instead, with onshore Wind alone slowest in all four.
# So yes, the rate of cost decline differs materially by technology, but which technology declines fastest (and slowest) is a function of the decarbonization scenario assumed, not a single fixed ranking -- see `build_cost_decline_summary` above for the exact figures behind this claim.
