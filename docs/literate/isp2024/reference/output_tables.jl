## Each factor is validated against the live static schema, so a renamed column
## fails the render rather than leaving a stale formula.

# A full outage removes the affected unit from service. A partial outage leaves the unit available at a reduced capability determined by the partial-outage and derating parameters. Mean time to repair is the average restoration duration after the corresponding outage state.

# ## Output directory pattern
#
# Static tables are written directly under a format directory such as `csv/` or `arrow/`. Time-varying tables are written under `schedule-<tag>/`, where the tag is either a planning year or an explicit date range.
#
# A schedule is an overlay, not an independent asset inventory. Reconstruct a system state by selecting the required scenario and timestamp, joining the schedule to its static table, and replacing only the quantity represented by the schedule.

# ## Using the output tables
#
# - Identifier columns define table relationships; row order does not.
# - `scenario` and `date` are part of the schedule key even when an analysis displays only one scenario or period.
# - Units follow the represented quantity: power and transfer limits are in MW, storage energy and inflow quantities are in MWh, and unit-count schedules are counts.
# - Solar and wind schedule values should not be normalised by static `Generator.pmax` without applying the modelling convention described in [Assumptions and scope](@ref).
