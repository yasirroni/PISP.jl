# ## Source roles
#
# The 2024 Inputs and Assumptions workbook supplies most structured planning assumptions. The ISP model archive supplies model-side material such as hydro inflow data; the generation and storage outlook supplies future development information; the trace archives supply half-hourly demand, solar, and wind profiles; and the supplementary 2023 and 2019 workbooks provide inputs that are not available in the main 2024 workbook.
#
# Source-derived values, code-derived values, and package assumptions have different provenance and update requirements. A new publication may require parser changes, while a changed package mapping can alter outputs even when the downloaded files are unchanged.

# ## Source contribution by output table
#
# PISP combines AEMO source files with package-defined mappings and records derived during dataset construction. The table summarises how each static output table is created and identifies additional source families used for its time-varying schedules. The static output tables covered here are read from the package's static-table schema, so the table cannot omit a table the schema defines.

## `RawMarkdown` emits assembled Markdown verbatim; the PrettyTables backend
## would escape the backticks and underscores this table relies on.
