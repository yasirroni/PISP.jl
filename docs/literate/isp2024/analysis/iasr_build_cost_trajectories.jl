# ## Cost-trajectory findings
#
# - Every matched technology declines between its first and last available projection year in every scenario.
# - The annualised decline rate ranges from about `-0.78%/yr` for fixed offshore wind under Current Policies/Progressive Change to about `-4.30%/yr` for eight-hour battery storage under Global NZE by 2050/Green Energy Exports.
# - The annualised decline-rate magnitude spans approximately 5.5-fold, so one technology-wide decline assumption would erase the observed scenario and technology differences.
#
# ## Interpretation
#
# The fastest-declining technology depends on the scenario.
# Large-scale solar declines fastest in the two lower-decarbonisation scenario rows, while longer-duration batteries decline fastest in the four higher-decarbonisation rows.
# The workbook therefore supplies scenario-conditioned cost assumptions rather than one fixed technology ranking.
#
# ## Limitations
#
# - These are input assumptions from the workbook, not realised project costs or forecasts guaranteed to occur.
# - The comparison does not add financing, operating costs, project-specific connection costs, or construction constraints.
# - The CAGR-style measure summarises the first-to-last change and does not describe every intermediate-year step.
# - Pumped hydro and BOTN assumptions are intentionally excluded.
#
# ## Cost-input use
#
# Preserve the workbook scenario when selecting build costs and avoid applying one decline rate across technologies.
# Studies comparing technology economics should retain the original `$/kW` basis and add other cost components explicitly rather than attributing them to this table.
