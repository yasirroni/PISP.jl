# # Comparing historical solar and wind reference years
#
# A single reference year can conceal substantial interannual variation in renewable availability.
# This page uses the evidence from `eda/03_year_comparison.jl` to compare annual and seasonal capacity factors, low-output days, and the most adverse summer solar day across the available historical traces.
#
# The comparison is location-specific: solar uses `Bannerton_SAT` and wind uses `DUNDWF1`.
# Results should not be generalised to all Victorian renewable resources without additional spatial analysis.

# ## Annual variation
#
# Annual means establish the scale of year-to-year variation before seasonal or extreme-event metrics are considered.

annual_cf_variability_summary = read_eda03("annual_cf_variability_summary")

# ## Seasonal variation
#
# Seasonal summaries separate summer and winter behaviour for each historical year.
# A final interpretation should distinguish variation between seasons from variation between years within the same season.

seasonal_cf_by_year = read_eda03("seasonal_cf_by_year")
preview_eda03(seasonal_cf_by_year; rows = 20)

# ## Low-output frequency
#
# Solar and wind use different low-output metrics in the source EDA: solar counts days whose midday maximum is below the threshold, while wind uses daily mean capacity factor.
# Their percentages are therefore not directly interchangeable without retaining the metric definition.

low_output_days_by_year = read_eda03("low_output_days_by_year")
preview_eda03(low_output_days_by_year; rows = 20)

# ## Worst summer solar day in each year
#
# This table identifies the minimum midday-maximum solar day within each sampled summer.
# It is an event-screening metric rather than a complete adequacy or energy-shortfall measure.

worst_summer_day_by_year = read_eda03("worst_summer_day_by_year")
worst_summer_day_by_year

# ## Interpretation after execution
#
# Replace this section after inspecting the rendered evidence.
# The final interpretation should name the years and metrics that drive the observed range, explain whether annual means conceal seasonal extremes, and retain the location and threshold limitations next to any conclusion.
