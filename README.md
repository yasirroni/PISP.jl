# PISP.jl: Julia parser of the Integrated System Plan

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PISP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PISP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

**PISP** (short for *Julia Parser of the Integrated System Plan*) is an open-source toolkit for parsing and generating structured datasets of the East Coast Australian Power System for power system studies.

The data parsing functionalities are built on publicly available information from the Integrated System Plan (ISP) released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM).

> [!CAUTION]
> The current release is fully functional and has been extensively tested; however, bugs or other issues may still arise. We would greatly appreciate any feedback or bug reports submitted via <https://github.com/ARPST-UniMelb/PISP.jl/issues>

## Core function

Dataset construction in PISP is performed through a single high-level function, `build_ISP24_datasets`. Two usage examples are shown below.

**By planning year** (original mode):

```julia
using PISP

# Set some of the input parameters (see all parameters below)
reference_trace = 4006         # Reference weather trace. 4006 is the one of the Optimal Development Path (ODP) of the ISP
poe             = 10           # Probability of exceedance (POE) for demand
target_years    = [2030, 2031] # Planning years for which to generate datasets

PISP.build_ISP24_datasets(
    downloadpath = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-downloads"),
    poe          = poe,
    reftrace     = reference_trace,
    years        = target_years,
    output_root  = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-datasets"),
    write_csv    = true,
    write_arrow  = false,
    scenarios    = [1,2,3]
    )
```

**By arbitrary date range** (new `drange` mode):

```julia
using PISP

# Build datasets for specific date windows instead of full calendar years
PISP.build_ISP24_datasets(
    downloadpath = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-downloads"),
    poe          = 10,
    reftrace     = 4006,
    drange       = [("01-01-2030", "31-03-2030"), ("01-07-2031", "30-09-2031")],
    output_root  = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-datasets"),
    write_csv    = true,
    write_arrow  = false,
    scenarios    = [1,2,3]
    )
```

## Download 2024 ISP report PDFs

Download the ten selected 2024 ISP report PDFs from AEMO with:

```julia
using PISP

report_paths = PISP.download_isp_reports(
    outdir    = joinpath(@__DIR__, "..", "data", "pisp-reports"),
    overwrite = false,
    )
```

To inspect the ten targets (key, title, filename, source URL) without downloading anything:

```julia
using PISP

for target in PISP.ISPReportDownloader.isp_report_targets()
    println(target.key, " -> ", target.filename)
end
```

## Optional parameters for PISP.build_ISP24_datasets()

There are multiple parameters that can be adjusted when generating the dataset from the public 2024 Integrated System Plan (ISP) datafiles:

| Parameter           | Default       | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`downloadpath`|"../../data-download"| Path where all files from AEMO's website will be downloaded and extracted
|`download_from_AEMO`|true| Whether to download files from AEMO's website
|`poe`|10| Probability of exceedance (POE) for demand: 10% or 50%
|`reftrace`|4006| Reference weather year trace: select among 2011 - 2023 or 4006 (trace for the Optimal Development Path, ODP from the 2024 ISP)
|`years`|nothing| Planning years for which to build the time-varying schedules: select among 2025 - 2050. Mutually exclusive with `drange`. Defaults to `[2025]` when neither `years` nor `drange` is provided.
|`drange`|nothing| Alternative to `years`. An array of 2-tuples `(start, end)` where each element may be a `Date`, `DateTime`, or `AbstractString` in `"DD-MM-YYYY"` format. One dataset is generated per tuple per scenario. Output folders are named `schedule-DDMMYYYY-DDMMYYYY`. Mutually exclusive with `years`.
|`output_name`|"out"| Output folder name
|`output_root`|nothing| Output folder path
|`write_csv`|true| Whether to write CSV (.csv) files
|`write_arrow`|true|Whether to write Arrow (.arrow) files
|`scenarios`|[1,2,3]|Scenarios to include in the output: 1 for `Progressive Change`, 2 for `Step Change`, 3 for `Green Energy Exports`, from the 2024 ISP
